## About the project ‚Ñπ

This project consists in a Advice Generator using the [Advice API](https://api.adviceslip.com). 
The project allows users to generate random advices by pressing a dice icon. The technologies I used for bulding this application were HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

### The challenge üöÄ

Throughout the development of the project, I had a design of the final interface in both devices. I had to develop and choose the dimensions according to my personal judgment. 

Users should be able to: 
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon.

## What I learned ‚ùì

Throughout the development of the project, I learned 2 new things: 

1- **How to add a box shadow on the entire container**: 
```css
#change-advice-button:hover{
    box-shadow: 0 0 28px var(--neon-green);
}
```

2- **How to use `transform: translateY()` to set a new position of an element inside its div, without using `position: relative` or `position: absolute`.**

```css 
#change-advice-button {
    transform: translateY(50%);
    height: 50px;
    width: 50px;
    border-radius: 100%;
    background-color: var(--neon-green);
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    transition: all .3s;
}
```

### Useful resources 
- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6821295/add-css-box-shadow-around-the-whole-div) - This helped me to discover how to use `box-shadow` in the whole div.
